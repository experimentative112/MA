## 🏛️ System Architecture 

![Layers1](screenshots/Layers11.png)  

---

<details>
<summary> 🌟 Confidence Scoring System</summary>

This system implements a **hierarchical four-tier confidence model** designed to maximize precision and minimize false classifications during automated paper screening and data extraction. The logic prioritizes **deterministic rule-based decisions** before progressively falling back to algorithmic and heuristic estimation only when necessary.


## ❓ Overview

The confidence score reflects how reliably a paper has been classified or extracted. Scores range from **0.0 to 1.0**, where higher values indicate stronger certainty and lower values explicitly flag the need for manual review.

The system operates in the following order:

1. Deterministic Rule-Based Classification  (Screener specific)
2. LLM Self-Assessment  
3. Heuristic Keyword Estimation  
4. Low-Confidence Default  

Text: Tier 1 (Deterministic) 
→
 Tier 2 (LLM) 
→
 Tier 3 (Heuristic) 
→
 Tier 4 (Default).

Each tier is only activated if the previous tier fails to produce a valid and reliable result.

![Fig1](screenshots/Fig1.png)  


## ✔️ Tier 1: Deterministic Rule-Based Classification (Highest Priority) 

**Purpose:** Eliminate ambiguity using explicit user-defined rules. For screener, Extractor starts directly from Tier 2.

**Logic:**
- The system performs a preliminary scan for **exclusion** and **inclusion** keywords.
- If **exclusion keywords are detected without any corresponding inclusion keywords**, the paper is:
  - Automatically classified as **Excluded**
  - Assigned a **confidence score of 1.0 (100%)**
- If **both exclusion and inclusion keywords** are present:
  - This tier is **bypassed** to avoid false positives
  - The decision is delegated to the AI-based evaluation

**Rationale:**  
Explicit rules provide deterministic certainty and override probabilistic inference when applicable.


## ✔️ Tier 2: LLM Self-Assessment (Primary Mechanism)

**Purpose:** Leverage the model’s internal reasoning and evidence-based judgment.

**Logic:**
- The Large Language Model (LLM) is explicitly instructed to:
  - Evaluate its own screening or extraction decision
  - Assign a **confidence score between 0.0 and 1.0**
  - Base the score strictly on **explicit textual evidence**
- The confidence value is parsed directly from the model’s structured JSON output

**Rationale:**  
This tier captures nuanced contextual understanding that deterministic rules cannot, while maintaining transparency through self-reported certainty.


## ✔️ Tier 3: Heuristic Keyword Estimation (Fallback)

**Purpose:** Provide a probabilistic estimate when LLM confidence is unavailable.

**Triggered when:**
- The LLM fails to return a valid confidence value (e.g., formatting or JSON parsing errors)

**Screener Logic:**
- The system analyzes the users input **Inclusions and Exclusions criteria** and matches with the paper's full-text and determines the confidence level.

**Extractor Logic:**
- The system analyzes **Extracted data** with the paper's full-text and determines the confidence level.


**Rationale:**  
This tier offers a best-effort estimate derived from text structure rather than semantic certainty.


## ✔️ Tier 4: Low-Confidence Default (Last Resort)

**Purpose:** Explicitly flag unreliable outputs.

**Triggered when:**
- Data extraction fails entirely (e.g., Regex failure or missing sections)

**Logic:**
- Assigns a **baseline low confidence score** (e.g., `0.2`)
- Automatically flags the result for **mandatory manual review**

**Rationale:**  
Prevents silent failures by clearly signaling unreliability.


This layered approach ensures that high-confidence decisions are automated safely, while ambiguous or unreliable cases are clearly flagged for human oversight.

## ⭐ Confidence Score Interpretation

| Confidence Score | Classification | Description | Implication |
|------------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| **1.0 (100%)** | Definitive Match | Deterministic rule-based classification / No ambiguity. | Fully automated decision |
| **0.8 – 1.00** | Very High Confidence | AI strongly validates the decision using explicit textual evidence. | Safe to accept |
| **0.6 – 0.79** | High Confidence | Criteria appear satisfied based on standard academic structure and content. | Review optional |
| **0.4 – 0.59** | Moderate Confidence | Ambiguous context or loosely met criteria. | Manual verification recommended |
| **0.1 – 0.39** | Low Confidence | Based mainly on heuristic keyword estimation. | High risk of error |
| **< 0.1** | Unreliable | Derived from fallback or failed extraction methods. | Mandatory manual review |

<summary>📦 Bulletproof Parsing Pipeline</summary>

**Purpose:** Safely parse API/AI responses, even if the JSON is broken or missing.

![Fig2](screenshots/Fig2.png) 

### Flow

1. **If `raw_result` is `None`**
   → Use regex to extract data locally.

2. **Clean the response**
   → Remove Markdown, comments, and trailing commas.

3. **Try standard JSON parsing**
   → `json.loads`

4. **If that fails, try JSON5**
   → Handles loose / malformed JSON.

5. **If that fails, use AI repair**
   → Ask AI to fix the JSON.

6. **Final fallback**
   → Extract known keys using regex.

### Guarantee

* Never crashes
* Always attempts to recover usable data
